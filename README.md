# Data-Viz-Redesign-Project<br><br>
## Instructions<br>
The objective of this project is to redesign a data visualization (e.g., an infographic, a data visualization in a newspaper, a project report, or a sales report). This will allow you to learn from others, sharpen your critical perspective on data visualizations, reason about design decisions, and attempt to improve data visualizations.
